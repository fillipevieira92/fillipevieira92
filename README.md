### Hi there! ðŸ˜ƒ
My name is **Fillipe Vieira** and I am currently living in the state of **Paraiba** in **Brazil**.
I'm an **IT student**, currently studying **Internet Systems**.
I consider myself a **curious person**, who is always **looking for** new **knowledge**.
<p></p>
<p>
I've been studying programming for a few years, I started with the MQL language in 2018, where I got to do some work as a freelancer. After this period, I started to occupy myself with other tasks and put programming aside, I returned to my studies in January 2021 with Python and I went deeper into the language until I decided to seek training in the area and that was when I entered college. Since then I have been gaining a lot of learning, at the end of October 2021 I got my current job as FullStack where I had the opportunity to expand my knowledge. In 2021 I also did some freelance work, including for companies abroad and I'm looking for more growth.</p>
