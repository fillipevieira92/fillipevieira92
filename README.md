### Hi there! ðŸ˜ƒ

My name is Fillipe, I'm 30 years old, I live in JoÃ£o Pessoa - ParaÃ­ba and I'm the father of a 4-year-old princess. Currently I work as a fullstack developer focusing on python, django and javascript. I have proven experience in systems analysis and development from start to finish. Currently I am also studying Internet Systems at UNIESP College.

I adapt and learn new technologies easily, always aiming to follow good development practices. I've worked with the development of complex systems, creation and maintenance of scripts for process automation, data modeling and others.

I try to maintain a good rapport with the team, I communicate well and I have the vision of an owner - mainly because I have worked as a self-employed professional for most of my life. I appreciate working using agile methodologies, with commitment and organization, always seeking punctuality and excellence in my deliveries.
